## Running My Program

Since I created a jar file for my program, there are two ways to run it. The first way is to run the jar file from the command line. The second way is to run the jar file from an IDE.

### Running the Jar File from the Command Line (Preferred Method)
To run the jar file from the command line, you will need to open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the jar file is located. Once you are in the correct directory, you can run the following command to execute the jar file:

`java -jar <jar-file-name>.jar`

In this case the file name is `my-program.jar`, so the command would be:

`java -jar hospital.jar`

From there you can follow the simple prompts to interact with the program.


### Extra Files included in project, but not necessary for running the program
- final_create_tables_and_insert_into_statements -> This is the file for the create table and insert into statements requested in the project
- final_queries -> This is the file for the queries in regular SQL format requested in the project
- DatabaseUtils -> This is a class that I created to make database set up easier while testing
